## Description

This is the simplest DUINO coin mining board design with four Atmega328p and CH340 connected to the FE1.1S USB hub. All that's needed to mine with this board is a micro USB/USB A cable to connect with a computer and the AVR_Miner application installed. 
One version of the PCB is with CH340C and for me, that version works great. But only the CH340C can be used here. Due to difficulties in buying quality chips, I did another design where CH340G is used. On this PCB, both versions of CH340 can be used without any problems. I made this design for fun and I hope it can be useful to someone
